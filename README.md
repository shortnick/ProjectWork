# ProjectWork

This script is a work in progress. It uses a url or list of urls to turn youtube videos into audio files (.mp3). It can handle individual songs (Improving version can handle playlists). 

Working version requires youtube-dl ( https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) and ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/).
